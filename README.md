# SinisterRooster_Prototype2Collab
Note:  There are some bad practices in here that you can feel free to change if it corresponds to your assingment (or to just try to code around it generically).  For example, I used a square sprite and a rectangle sprite and to get different shapes, I changed the x, y, z scaling -- this is not going to happen when the artists give us a finished piece that they've scaled how they want it, and so swapping it in is harder because then you change the scales back to 1,1,1 which is problematic if your code was dependent on the irregular scale values.  For the most part, it's not going to be a big problem for this little prototype (especially since art might not get much or anything to us to put in by Thursday).
